A set of jQuery widgets are available that can be used within a node's edit template.

  - __[TypedInput](typedInput)__ - a replacement for a regular `<input>` that allows
    the type of the value to be chosen, including options for string, number and boolean.
    Used extensively in the core Node-RED nodes.
  - __[EditableList](editableList)__ - an editable list where the elements can be complex
    forms in their own right. Used by the core `Switch` and `Change` nodes.
