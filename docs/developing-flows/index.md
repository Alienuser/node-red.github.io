With Node-RED, you can create an application quickly.
In particular, creating small IoT applications is very easy even if you use Node-RED in an adhoc manner.
However, if you create relatively large applications or create applications with your team, like an enterprise development, you may want practices and tips to create more reusable and readable flows.
Therefore, this Developing Flows guidelines are intended for providing such knowledge.

This guideline assume that you already know basic usage of Node-RED.
If you are a starter and you want to know just how to use Node-RED, please read [User Guide](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/) and [Cookbook](https://cookbook.nodered.org/) first.

### [Designing](designing)

Descriptions about designing strategy before developing flows.

### [Implementation](implementation)

Explanations about phases of the flow implementation.

### [Readability](readability)

Guideline for improving readability to create a reusable flows

### [Project](multiple-developers)

Project management methods for developing flows among multiple people

### [Non-functional requirements](non-functional)

Techniques to meet non-functional requirements.

*Before adding guideline to the Node-RED official page through a pull request, we would like to discuss contents and where to place it with somebody who are interested in this guideline. This wiki page is for discussing them.*  

*At first, weâ€™d like to show a contents list and where to place it on Node-RED official page. After that, we will write the actual contents and discuss it with Node-RED community because we would reduce unnecessary work.*
