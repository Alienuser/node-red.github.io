<div class="doc-callout">
<em>Note</em> :  Parts of the user guide assume the reader is somewhat familiar with
<strong>JavaScript</strong> (not Java).  There are many online resources to get up
to speed with JavaScript. Mozilla, for example, has a good
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript">re-introduction to JavaScript</a>
that should get you headed in the right direction.

### Other places to get help

If you have a question, suggestion or just want to say hello, there are various
places you can do so:

 - Join the [Node-RED Forum](https://discourse.nodered.org)
 - Subscribe to the [blog](http://blog.nodered.org)
 - Join us on [Slack](http://nodered.org/slack/)
 - Follow [@nodered](http://twitter.com/nodered) on Twitter

We also have the old [Google Group mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/node-red) - that is being retired in favour of the [forum](https://discourse.nodered.org), but there's still a lot of useful content on there that is worth searching.
